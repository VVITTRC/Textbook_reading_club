VVIT TR Club

The VVIT TR Club application is currently in a stable and fully functional development stage. The core architecture of the system has been completed, and both backend and frontend components are successfully integrated. The application runs locally with the backend served through FastAPI and the frontend through React (Vite), and all primary workflows for administrators and students are operational. The system has been tested for end-to-end functionality including authentication, cohort management, PDF reading, note creation, and real-time chat communication.

On the backend side, the database schema has been fully designed and implemented using SQLAlchemy with SQLite as the storage engine. All essential models including Users, Cohorts, Cohort Members, Private Notes, Public Notes, and Chat Messages have been structured and connected through proper relationships. Authentication is implemented using bcrypt-based password hashing, and role-based access control distinguishes between administrators and students. RESTful API endpoints for user registration, login, cohort creation, PDF uploads, note management, and administrative statistics have been implemented and tested. Real-time chat functionality using WebSockets is also fully functional within individual cohorts.

On the frontend side, the user interface has been developed using React with Tailwind CSS for styling. The application includes complete pages for login, registration, cohort browsing, PDF reading, note creation, and chat interaction. The PDF viewer is integrated using react-pdf and supports page navigation and zoom controls. API communication between frontend and backend is handled using Axios, and WebSocket connections enable real-time group chat. The interface is responsive and supports smooth navigation across different components.

The complete student workflow has been implemented and verified. A student can register, log in, browse available cohorts, join a cohort, access the assigned PDF, create private notes visible only to themselves, create public notes visible to all cohort members, and participate in real-time discussions. Similarly, the administrator workflow is fully functional. An administrator can log in, create cohorts, upload PDF textbooks, view overall system statistics, and monitor activity including notes and chat messages within each cohort.

Although the core functionality of the project is complete, certain enhancements remain pending for future development. These include advanced text highlighting features within the PDF viewer, improved editing and deletion options for notes, stronger input validation mechanisms, file upload validation for security, and improved user profile management. Additionally, the system currently runs in a local development environment, and production-level deployment configuration, environment variable management, HTTPS setup, and scalable database configuration are yet to be implemented.

Overall, the VVIT TR Club project has successfully reached the core implementation milestone. All fundamental features required for a collaborative textbook reading and discussion platform are complete and operational. The system is ready for academic demonstration, internal use, or further refinement toward production deployment.
